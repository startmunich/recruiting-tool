There I had independent customers and was able to learn a lot from the founder of the startup about how sales works and how to deal with customers.\nAt the same time, we expanded to India with the help of the German Accelorator program. There I was able to learn a lot about the \"Indian business world\".",
         "What idea would you pursue if you had unlimited resources and no fear of failure and what would be your first 3 steps?": "I would implement the idea from my current startup (still in the process of being founded). \nStep 1: Find a perfect match. Find another co-founder who is also convinced of the idea and does exactly the opposite as you. For example, if you do sales yourself, then your co-founder should be a computer scientist.\nStep 2: Build up a real network with lots of interesting people who can really help you. Don't be limited by location.\nStep 3: Find a mentor who has already founded many companies and can always help you when you need it.",

In my current venture, we \"skipped\" the traditional ideation phase, as our startup was founded on a clear industry need and use case. Looking forward, if I plan to found another startup, I aim to learn how to systematically identify and validate business ideas when not starting from an existing need. Through START, I see the opportunity not just to learn this skill but also to meet and network with great people with whom I could potentially found the next venture in the future. I am looking forward to joining this vibrant community!",
         "Tell us about an achievement or a personal project you are proud of and why?  ": "Last year, I fulfilled a lifetime dream of mine by founding a startup with three of my close colleagues out of BMW. Ever since my school days, I've had the determination and the desire to work independently and autonomously and at the same time aiming to build something with an impact. I am proud that I was able to achieve this at the young age of 19 years during my third semester at university. Looking back on this time, which is just over a year now, it's hard to grasp just how much has happened—I developed a fully functional software in just five months, mostly together with one of my co-founders, founded a GmbH, acquired over a dozen well-known corporate clients for our pilot projects, hired our first employees, and worked tirelessly not only on the vision but also on refining the details of our product. Simultaneously, I received a scholarship of the Bavarian EliteAcademy and continued my studies with very limited time, but quite successfully so far. While I am occupied with daily tasks and constantly looking to the future, I hardly look at all that we have accomplished in such a short time, but when I do, I can only be proud of myself and, more importantly, my fantastic co-founders, colleagues and friends without whom this venture would be unimaginable.",
         "What are your plans and goals for the following 2 years and how can START in particular help you to achieve them?": "Lately, I've spent a lot of time thinking about what my life will look like in the coming years: should I pursue a master's degree after my bachelor's thesis this fall and continue to develop the startup alongside my studies, or should I pause my academic pursuits to focus entirely on the startup, possibly resuming my studies later? This is not an easy decision for me, as I still have ambitious academic goals, which is why I decided to do an internship at a chair at TUM. My big goal is to study abroad at a top American university, diving deep into research, which highly fascinates me. And given the positive feedback from my colleagues at the chair, this goal seems achievable after my bachelor.\nHowever, after several discussions with my professor, co-founders, and others, I am leaning strongly towards focusing entirely on the startup. We plan to position our software across the entire German and later international OEM market and to scale into other industries (currently chemicals and electronics). As mentioned, this will involve raising investment and hiring new people. I believe the START community could be a tremendous help in this phase, providing advice, tips, and contacts. I also think that improving my soft skills through workshops will prepare me ideally for this period.",

         "What idea would you pursue if you had unlimited resources and no fear of failure and what would be your first 3 steps?": "I would found a deep-tech startup that directly emerges from research, which has its complexity as USP, and which should be as fundamental as e.g. Chat-GPT is for other businesses / startups. My steps would be: I would first go to the US to start a PhD at a famous university in a topic which is very promising for future high-tech solutions (like maybe Quantum Computing or some form of AI), there I would join a bunch of different startup-initiatives to meet high-skilled people who share my interest and then I would work as hard as I can, to understand the topic extremely well before taking the first steps to found / work on the product.",
         "Imagine you could switch lives with any person for a day. Who would you choose, why, and what would you do in their shoes?": "I would very much like to swap roles with Donald Trump for a day if he is re-elected as president this fall. I want to understand whether he really knows and understands as little as it sometimes appears, or if there's actually a lot of calculation behind his actions. Then, I would see if being him it is indeed possible to end the war in Ukraine in one day, as he has often claimed it would be.",

I recently participated in the Start Hack and Start Summit in St. Gallen and saw the positive effect and impact a proper community could have on you. I discovered how easier and more exciting it becomes to build when you're surrounded by like-minded people.

I have also started multiple projects that never got to see life, but that helped me a lot with the experience I have learned. One of the best projects I have, is one that has been following since my first years here. It's freelancing project, where I build portfolios and websites, for particulars, I have also built an online platform for them where they can modify their website (content and some of the styling) without having to have coding knowledge. This project is the biggest to me not because of the material gain or achievement, but because of how I saw myself grow with it, I even could witness throughout the different tries how my technical abilities changed, how my confidence in my abilities also evolved especially, when selling myself to newer customers or even in other areas in life.

Being part of START Munich would empower me to harness my project management and analytical thinking skills in a setting that breathes social entrepreneurship. With my background in promoting educational initiatives and fostering partnerships, I see a unique opportunity to contribute to and thrive in the vibrant, diverse community of START Munich.\n\nHere, I can further refine my leadership qualities, as START Munich presents the perfect ecosystem to grow my enterprenual drive, providing a platform where I can leverage my practical knowledge from successfully managing and executing digital marketing strategies across Google, Snapchat, and Facebook Ads.\n\nMoreover, my ESTJ personality profile means I am a natural organizer and confident decision-maker, traits that align with START's ethos of proactivity and initiative. My cultural adaptability and history of interacting within diverse environments abroad have equipped me with a keen sense for collaborative ventures, which is at the heart of START's mission.\n",
         "Tell us about an achievement or a personal project you are proud of and why?  ": "One achievement I hold in high regard is my role as a marketing specialist with the Thomas Edison Foundation — a position I've embraced voluntarily, channeling my commitment to community service and education. My work here is a testament to my dedication, performed entirely pro bono, mirroring START Munich's mission of altruism and societal contribution.\n\nRecently, I had the honor of holding a lecture for over 100 students at my former high school, where I introduced the values and vision of the foundation and illuminated the academic opportunities at TUM. This lecture was not just an educational initiative, but also a platform to inspire the next generation of innovators and thinkers.\n\nThe highlight of my work so far has been forging an invaluable partnership with DAAD Polska, a prominent Polish-German academic exchange platform. This collaboration underscored my capabilities in nurturing significant relationships and underscored the foundation's and my personal emphasis on intercultural cooperation. Stemming from this partnership, I was entrusted with the responsibility of orchestrating an online lecture for current bachelor students. This responsibility highlighted that leadership transcends age, showcasing my ability to engage and guide even those who are more experienced and older.\n\nBeyond these engagements, I conduct meetings with foundation’s members, offering guidance on gaining admission to TUM. These sessions are a reflection of my ability to direct effectively.\n\n",
         "What are your plans and goals for the following 2 years and how can START in particular help you to achieve them?": "Over the next two years, my goal is to enhance my entrepreneurial skills and leadership abilities, crucial for my studies at Technische Universität München and my career ambitions. This is my second application to START Munich, which underscores my strong belief in the organization’s ability to support my development.\n\nAfter reflecting on last year’s feedback, I have decided to focus on specific opportunities at START Munich. I am eager to take part in the START Summit, as well as the mentorship programs and networking events. These experiences are vital as they will help me build a network with intelligent and ambitious individuals, which is essential as I plan to launch my own startup within the next 2-3 years.\n\nEngaging deeply in these areas will also prepare me for a leadership role within START, as I aspire to become a team manager in the future. My aim for the following two years is to significantly contribute to the START community while setting the stage for my entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nBy dedicating myself to these selected activities, I look forward to leveraging every learning opportunity at START Munich to propel myself toward these ambitious objectives.\n",

But most importantly I think they would say I am always ready to help, no matter the circumstances and very dedicated to what I’m doing. What I mean by that is, when I have to get something done, I always get it done, despite it could be hard and problematic.",
         "Please tell us about 3 hard skills you have and provide examples of previous experiences/projects where you applied them.": "1. Business Development\n\nI successfully managed two drop-shipping stores, one specializing in oral care products and the other in mobile phone chargers. I connected these stores to the retailer and automated various aspects of the business using software. These experiences showcase my expertise in e-commerce, product sourcing, and automation.\n\n2. Social Media Marketing\n\nI established and led a cryptocurrency trading group with over 250 members on Telegram. I promoted this group on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter, growing its membership and fostering an engaged community. These experiences highlight my ability to effectively leverage social media for promotion and community building.\n\n3. Pitching and Public Speaking\n\nOver the past six months, I've honed my skills in giving pitches and being a speaker through organizing and delivering detailed lectures to over 100 high school students. This experience has equipped me with the ability to effectively communicate ideas, engage audiences, and convey information with confidence and clarity.\n",
         "What idea would you pursue if you had unlimited resources and no fear of failure and what would be your first 3 steps?": "My dream project would revolve around leveraging Munich's rich academic and technological ecosystem for the greater good. As a committed student, I envision creating a cutting-edge platform that seamlessly connects university talents with local startups, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship within the Munich community.\n\nFirstly, I would conduct a comprehensive assessment of the academic and entrepreneurial landscape in Munich. This would involve mapping out the university departments, research centres, and technology hubs. I'd also re-identify the key players, both in terms of startups and established companies, to understand the existing networks and potential areas of collaboration.\n\nBuilding on my experiences in e-commerce and digital marketing, I'd continue forging strategic partnerships with influential organizations, including TUM, local startups, and innovation-focused foundations. My possible membership in START Munich would without a doubt be a good starting point. These collaborations would provide the foundation for the project, securing support and expertise.\n\nFor the last step, I'd invest in creating a state-of-the-art digital platform that acts as a hub for innovation. This platform would facilitate matchmaking between students and startups, offer resources for skill development, and encourage the exchange of ideas and solutions. It would defnintely be designed for scalability, enabling its expansion beyond Munich and fostering global connections.\n",
         "Imagine you could switch lives with any person for a day. Who would you choose, why, and what would you do in their shoes?": "If I could switch lives with someone for a day, I would choose to step into the shoes of Antoni Gaudí, the visionary Catalan architect known for his distinctive and imaginative creations. Having visited Barcelona three weeks ago and amazed by masterpieces like the Sagrada Familia and his other architectural wonders, I've been thirlled by Gaudí's unparalleled creativity and innovative approach to design.\n\nAs someone deeply fascinated by the intersection of art and engineering, I'm intrigued by Gaudí's creative process and his ability to push the boundaries of architecture beyond conventional norms. His deep connection to nature and his mastery of organic forms continue to inspire architects and artists around the world.\n\nMoreover, Gaudí's role as a mentor to aspiring architects and his influence on future generations of designers highlight his commitment to sharing knowledge and nurturing talent. Stepping into Gaudí's shoes for a day would offer a unique opportunity to gain insights into his creative genius, experience his design philosophy and perhaps uncover new perspectives on the intersection of art, architecture, and nature.\n",

We conducted extensive market research to ensure the viability and potential impact of our idea.\nOur efforts led to the development of a current startup idea that my co-founder and I are actively pursuing. Throughout the program, we not only validated the concept and conducted market research but also developed a functional prototype, which we had the opportunity to present to the Investment Committee. This experience honed my skills in team collaboration and rapid prototyping, and deepened my understanding of the critical factors that contribute to a startup's success.\nI am proud of this achievement because it demonstrated my ability to lead a project from conception through to the crucial stages of investor review.

The initial phase will involve finalizing our prototype, conducting pilot tests with target clients, and securing seed funding to facilitate these initiatives.\nSTART Munich can play a crucial role in achieving these objectives.

These issues are often difficult to solve let a lone express. If I could, I would pursue the creation of a universal empathy enhancer—a technology designed to deepen human understanding and empathy on a global scale. This device or system would use advanced neurotechnology to help individuals truly experience and understand the emotions and perspectives of others, thereby fostering global peace, reducing conflicts, and enhancing cooperation across races, genders, cultures, nations and all other divides that exist today. Let’s call this device the “empatrix”\nThe steps would be:\n1. Recruit a team of experts including neuroscientists, psychologists, technologists, ethicists, and cultural scholars. Their primary task would be to research and develop the Empathix, potentially as a wearable device or even a neural implant, designed to safely and effectively enhance empathy.\n2. Construct a prototype to showcase the technology’s capabilities within controlled settings. This stage would focus on demonstrating how the Empatrix can influence empathy in real-time, ensuring its practical application and effectiveness.\n3. Establish a comprehensive ethical framework to govern the use of the Empatrix. This framework would address issues of privacy, consent, and the ethical implications of enhancing human emotions.",

The unique perspective of viewing Earth from space is not only rare but profoundly impactful, providing insights into our planet's beauty, fragility, and the interconnectedness of all life.\nAs someone fascinated by science and technology, spending a day in space would offer firsthand insight into the day-to-day operations of space travel and living in a zero-gravity environment.\nI would spend significant time watching the Earth roll by beneath.

At that time, I had just been in the gym for a year and was very interested in the topics of training and nutrition. I have already shared the learnings that I have learned myself with friends and those around me in general, and then saw social media as a vehicle to share this knowledge with even more young people. So I posted every day and constantly tried to improve my content, which enabled me to grow my reach exponentially within 1.5 years. At my peak, my posts reached over 700,000 people every month. I'm particularly proud of this because I worked constantly on the vision every day for more than 1.5 years and was sometimes laughed at, but I didn't let it get me down.

For me, it's not about just starting a business that makes money, but one that helps the end customer lead a better life. A d2C brand is absolutely conceivable, although I don't want to limit myself too much to any one model. What I would certainly like to do before starting the company is to find one or more co-founders who will implement the vision together with me. In my positions in various startups, this was a point that definitely helped me to master the founding journey in the best possible way. Since starting a business brings with it many challenges, my goal is to develop myself personally in the best possible way during this time in order to grow beyond myself as a person and to overcome major challenges. Personal development and learning new things are also my biggest goals in the next 2 years. START can definitely help me get to know new, cool people who also want to start a business and think entrepreneurial.

Many people have already benefited from this knowledge through previous work in the gym and through Social Media.\nI was able to use my ability to conduct sales discussions during my time at a LinkedIn agency, as I advised over 100 people there on their business LinkedIn profile over a period of 6 months and qualified or disqualified them for final sales discussions. But everyone was able to gain added value from these discussions, which in my opinion is the most important thing in sales.",
         "What idea would you pursue if you had unlimited resources and no fear of failure and what would be your first 3 steps?": "I would definitely start a D2C brand in the area of biohacking, as it is a trend that is emerging more and more in Germany and can provide real added value for customers. My first 3 steps would be:\n1. Find a suitable co-founder with whom I get along well on a personal level, but whose skills also complement me.\n2. Build an MVP and get feedback from the target group as quickly as possible. Then revise the MVP so that the target group would be willing to spend money on it.\n3. Start a social media channel and document the journey of founding and the product so that at the final launch you have a small community that buys the product and can also give feedback, for example.",
         "Imagine you could switch lives with any person for a day. Who would you choose, why, and what would you do in their shoes?": "If given the opportunity, I'd absolutely jump at the chance to step into the shoes of a football icon like Manuel Neuer on a monumental Champions League match day.  Feeling the weight of the responsibility, and walking onto the pitch surrounded by the electric atmosphere of a packed stadium. The air crackles with anticipation, the crowd's roar reverberates through the air, and I stand there, heart pounding, ready to face whatever challenges come my way.\n\nBeing Neuer for a day means more than just playing a game; it's about immersing myself in the world of elite football, experiencing firsthand the thrill of competition at its highest level. From the moment the referee's whistle blows to kick off the match, every second is an adrenaline-fueled adventure, a test of skill, endurance, and mental fortitude.\n\nAs the game unfolds, I'd revel in the exhilaration of making split-second decisions, diving to make crucial saves, and leading my team with unwavering determination\n\nAnd when the final whistle blows, win or lose, I'd walk off the pitch with a full appreciation for the passion, dedication, and sheer love of the game that drives athletes like Manuel Neuer to strive for greatness every time they step onto the field. Being in his shoes, even for just a day, would be an unforgettable journey—an experience filled with highs, lows, and everything in between, but above all, a celebration of the beautiful game and the indomitable spirit of those who play it.",

What I am proud of is the work ethic and the discipline that I have built over the years being involved in multiple things at the same time.

         "What are your plans and goals for the following 2 years and how can START in particular help you to achieve them?": "Building my portfolio and coming to Germany took a lot of my time after high school so I did not have time to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. Since coming here, I tried to build a marketing agency to get started but the laws make it impossible for internationals to set up a business here. I found out about the start up culture of  TUM through the events I attended and the people I met. My goal is to meet like-minded people and build a network to eventually build something of my own.

         "What idea would you pursue if you had unlimited resources and no fear of failure and what would be your first 3 steps?": "Bring back nuclear energy plants. It is by far the most efficient way of generating energy and the fear of accidents should be long gone after the developments in the area over the years. All the talk about environment friendliness is actually just a tool to make money since the production of environment friendly products ends up producing a lot of carbon emissions. The best example are Electric cars. Nuclear energy on the other hand produces no carbon emissions and immense amounts of energy. There have been new and safe methods to dispose of nuclear waste as well. Here are the steps I would follow:\n1) Determine the safest possible location for a plant.\n2) Design a model based on the location with the appropriate people.\n3) Design a security system to ensure the safety of the workers.\nSince the government policy make it hard to bring back nuclear energy in Germany, I don't think this idea will be realized here anytime soon. In my opinion, Nuclear energy is the future and even though mistakes were made in the past, we should not be using traditional methods of generating energy since the side effects of these end up taking more lives in the long run anyway.",
         "Imagine you could switch lives with any person for a day. Who would you choose, why, and what would you do in their shoes?": "I would switch lives with the right hand of the Prime Minister (in my country). Under the impression of nationalism, a lot of people end up blindly following the leaders. I would like to have a peek into their daily lives and see if they actually work for the betterment of the people or make decisions based purely on self interest. It is hard for individuals to make big changes to the society but my dream has always been to create for the people. Politics plays a big role in the development of private companies so it is of great interest for me to find out if political leaders are true to their word. I do not know much about the politics in Germany but in India it is almost impossible to start a business without the involvement of the government in some form.",

         "I want to join START because I get to build or develop… ": "… an entrepreneurial mindset. To me, that means more than just spotting problems—it's about asking the right questions, thinking outside the box, and wondering why certain things haven't been tried before.\nWith my mathematics and computer science background, I've gained the necessary analytical problem-solving. But what excites me most is using this knowledge to make a real difference and improve existing systems.\nI know that university lectures might not fully prepare me for this journey, especially in my field. So, joining START would allow me to keep growing, providing the platform and resources to turn my ideas into practical solutions with real-world impact.\nI love exploring different subjects and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds to see how their unique perspectives can come together to create something amazing. That's why I'm eager to join START—I'm looking forward to being part of a community of fellow entrepreneurs who share the same passion for bringing ideas to life.\nI'm now applying for START Munich because I've always had a strong desire to start my own company. It's something I've wanted for as long as I can remember, even though diving into entrepreneurship can feel overwhelming at times. I don't have a background in economics, so discussions with economics students sometimes leave me feeling a bit out of my depth.\nIn short, my goal is to explore these subjects further and find my place among inspiring individuals and fellow entrepreneurs.",
         "Tell us about an achievement or a personal project you are proud of and why?  ": "One significant achievement for me is my double degree in mathematics and computer science. It all began with a pivotal decision to shift from law studies, realizing my true passion lay elsewhere. This transition was a hard lesson that taught me the value of prioritizing personal dreams over conventional paths. \nMy double degree project then led me through some challenging times. Initially, juggling both degrees felt manageable, but as the difficulty increased and the workload intensified, I often questioned whether I wanted to continue studying at all. While my friends enjoyed their breaks, I usually spent mine studying non-stop. Through this experience, I discovered my drive to work at the edge of my capacities. Attempting to slow down or simplify things only left me yearning for new challenges. It's a delicate balance, and I've learned the importance of understanding my limits while continuously testing them. \nNow, having completed my first degree in mathematics, I feel immensely proud of myself. With my master's degree in Data Science—a perfect blend of my bachelor's degrees—I've also discovered the field of \"Legal Data Science,“ reigniting my interest in legal work, making all the effort and hard work worthwhile. Looking ahead, I'm excited to explore the entrepreneurial side of legal tech, blending my academic backgrounds and experiences. I'm eager to make a difference and apply all the knowledge I've gained so far, hoping to learn even more along the way.",
         "What are your plans and goals for the following 2 years and how can START in particular help you to achieve them?": "In the next two years, I aim to complete my master's degree while deepening my understanding of data science and legal tech. Additionally, I want to explore the entrepreneurial mindset and learn how businesses are started and grown. My overall goal is to develop a mindset where I focus on identifying, understanding, and solving problems with creative solutions.\n\nThis aligns perfectly with the current point in my life when things are starting to fall into place. I do see START Munich as a crucial part of this journey. It's not just a platform; it's a place where I can grow and learn with like-minded people who share my passion for entrepreneurship.\nI believe being part of START’s community will help me learn from different perspectives and expand my horizons.\n\nI'm excited about the structured process of becoming a 'STARTie,' from the onboarding to the sprints and the workshops. It's a chance for me to learn both the „hard facts“ of founding and entrepreneurship while also learning from my peers and build something meaningful together.\nOverall, I'm confident that START Munich will provide me with the support and resources I need to succeed in the world of entrepreneurship. I am excited about the journey of growth and discovery that lies ahead.",
         "Name 3 things your friends would say about you.": "I would say the three things are: 'Driven,' 'Laughs a lot,' and 'Very reliable, except for the fact that she's always five minutes late.'",
         "Please tell us about 3 hard skills you have and provide examples of previous experiences/projects where you applied them.": "Programming: I've learned programming through my studies but also taught myself using platforms like Codecademy, especially focusing on front-end development, which isn't covered extensively in my university curriculum.\n\nWorking in an initiative: My involvement with the Young Liberals (JuLis) and various boards has equipped me with valuable insights into how initiatives function and the common pitfalls they encounter. Recently, my participation in TUM.ai has underscored the importance of effective organization and community leadership in achieving success within such initiatives.\n\n\nLanguages: I love speaking and learning a lot of languages, as it enables me to communicate more directly with people from different backgrounds. During my time as an exchange student in Russia, where I also learned Russian, I was therefore able to connect better with the people and students I met there. But also back here in Germany, I more than once helped translate or just talked to Russian-speaking people. And I do really want to learn as many languages as possible, because I don't believe in limiting my world because of borders and political differences. Besides German, Englisch, and Slovenian I therefore learned French, some Spanisch, some Russian and currently started learning Hebrew.",
         "What idea would you pursue if you had unlimited resources and no fear of failure and what would be your first 3 steps?": "Day 1: I'd convene a meeting with key leaders (both political and economic) continent-wise, asking them to outline the major present and future challenges in simple terms and suggest solutions.\n\nDay 2: I'd assemble a team of capable individuals to swiftly analyze the information, leveraging technology and data to devise practical solutions. By day's end, we'd aim to have preliminary approaches ready for presentation.\n\nDay 3: We now start to realize as many of the projects as possible, as the time is running out. \n\nThis assumes that the time of important individuals, a skilled team, and sufficient funding for all projects are part of unlimited resources. It might sound like a superficial plan, but let me get more specific: If everybody is talking about missing education, then we could use the already available technology to make it accessible for everyone. If they then need laptops, they do get those. If they need a translation, we provide it with transformer models like GPT. Starting simple projects and finding simple answers might not solve the big problems, but I think starting them, testing them, and evaluating why they might fail and what a solution accounting for the failure could be would be the most important first step. \nAnd maybe, doing those things as a private person or company is just so much easier than doing them as a country. Therefore I think that we all have an obligation to use our power to make the world a little bit better or at least try our best.",
         "Imagine you could switch lives with any person for a day. Who would you choose, why, and what would you do in their shoes?": "This question is tough to decide. On the one hand, through my interest in LegalTech, I would love to see a very proficient and highly decorated lawyer work or even do his job (hoping that I gain his knowledge for the day, too). That would give me a great insight into the needs and tasks of lawyers working on high-profile cases, making it more accessible for me to develop and design technical solutions supporting them.\n\nOn the other hand, I would also love to switch with someone who lives a completely opposite life to mine, on a different continent with a completely different culture and duties than I have. I really want to understand how different the world looks through different eyes, and I think one day, in the shoes of such an opposite life, I could be a real eye-opener about how much there is out there to explore and understand.",

In school I actually worked in a small forge and learned how to shape iron into the right form and made my own hammer there ",
         "What idea would you pursue if you had unlimited resources and no fear of failure and what would be your first 3 steps?": "First of all I'm not really afraid of failure. Second of all, if I actually had unlimited resources I would try to do the most exiting thing in the universe, which is making the solarsystem or our  galaxy available for us. So I would focus on making rockets that go to orbit affordable and reusable. First 3 steps would be to develop a 10 year plan/philosophy (motivational purposes and telling why the mission is important) Then I would build a team, who is crazy enough to believe in it, but are also able to execute. And then I would analyze the current tech innovation and how it could help us to achieve that goal.",
